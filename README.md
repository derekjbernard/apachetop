    Kill all processes that are running for longer than 2 minutes:
    
        apachetop --mintime 120 --kill
    
    Find longest running apache procs on all web and app servers and 
    sort on duration
    
        pboxes -f web,app  --ssh "apachetop --mintime 600" | sort -nk7
    
    Find all "graciously closing" procs, that will probably never ever

        apachetop --state R  --mintime 10 --kill
    
    Kill everything with request time > 20 sec, if total amount of 
    active procs is > 120.
    
        apachetop --kill --mintime 10 --minprocs 120
    
    Find all procs that are sending data, sorted on number of procs per 
    site.
    
        pboxes -f app --ssh "apachetop --state W" | awk '{ print $13; }' |        sort | uniq -c | sort -n
